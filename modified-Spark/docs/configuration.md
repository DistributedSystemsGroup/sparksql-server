Spark provides three locations to configure the system:

* [Spark properties](#spark-properties) control most application parameters and can be set by using
  a [SparkConf](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf) object, or through Java
  system properties.
* [Environment variables](#environment-variables) can be used to set per-machine settings, such as
  the IP address, through the `conf/spark-env.sh` script on each node.
* [Logging](#configuring-logging) can be configured through `log4j.properties`.

# Spark Properties

Spark properties control most application settings and are configured separately for each
application. These properties can be set directly on a
[SparkConf](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf) passed to your
`SparkContext`. `SparkConf` allows you to configure some of the common properties
(e.g. master URL and application name), as well as arbitrary key-value pairs through the
`set()` method. For example, we could initialize an application with two threads as follows:

Note that we run with local[2], meaning two threads - which represents "minimal" parallelism,
which can help detect bugs that only exist when we run in a distributed context.

{% highlight scala %}
val conf = new SparkConf()
             .setMaster("local[2]")
             .setAppName("CountingSheep")
             .set("spark.executor.memory", "1g")
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we can have more than 1 thread in local mode, and in cases like spark streaming, we may actually
require one to prevent any sort of starvation issues.

## Dynamically Loading Spark Properties
In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a `SparkConf`. For
instance, if you'd like to run the same application with different masters or different
amounts of memory. Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf:

{% highlight scala %}
val sc = new SparkContext(new SparkConf())
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can supply configuration values at runtime:
{% highlight bash %}
./bin/spark-submit --name "My app" --master local[4] --conf spark.shuffle.spill=false
  --conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps" myApp.jar
{% endhighlight %}

The Spark shell and [`spark-submit`](submitting-applications.html)
tool support two ways to load configurations dynamically. The first are command line options,
such as `--master`, as shown above. `spark-submit` can accept any Spark property using the `--conf`
flag, but uses special flags for properties that play a part in launching the Spark application.
Running `./bin/spark-submit --help` will show the entire list of these options.

`bin/spark-submit` will also read configuration options from `conf/spark-defaults.conf`, in which
each line consists of a key and a value separated by whitespace. For example:

    spark.master            spark://5.6.7.8:7077
    spark.executor.memory   512m
    spark.eventLog.enabled  true
    spark.serializer        org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer

Any values specified as flags or in the properties file will be passed on to the application
and merged with those specified through SparkConf. Properties set directly on the SparkConf
take highest precedence, then flags passed to `spark-submit` or `spark-shell`, then options
in the `spark-defaults.conf` file. A few configuration keys have been renamed since earlier
versions of Spark; in such cases, the older key names are still accepted, but take lower
precedence than any instance of the newer key.

## Viewing Spark Properties

The application web UI at `http://<driver>:4040` lists Spark properties in the "Environment" tab.
This is a useful place to check to make sure that your properties have been set correctly. Note
that only values explicitly specified through `spark-defaults.conf`, `SparkConf`, or the command
line will appear. For all other configuration properties, you can assume the default value is used.

## Available Properties

Most of the properties that control internal settings have reasonable default values. Some
of the most common options to set are:

#### Application Properties
<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>

  <td><code>spark.app.name</code></td>
  <td>(none)</td>

    is above this limit.
    Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory
    and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from
    out-of-memory errors.

    directly in your application, because the driver JVM has already started at that point.

    Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during shuffles, if
    <code>spark.shuffle.spill</code> is true. At any given time, the collective size of
    all in-memory maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the contents will

#### Cluster Managers
Each cluster manager in Spark has additional configuration options. Configurations
can be found on the pages for each mode:

 * [YARN](running-on-yarn.html#configuration)
 * [Mesos](running-on-mesos.html)
 * [Standalone Mode](spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts)

# Environment Variables

Certain Spark settings can be configured through environment variables, which are read from the
`conf/spark-env.sh` script in the directory where Spark is installed (or `conf/spark-env.cmd` on
Windows). In Standalone and Mesos modes, this file can give machine specific information such as
hostnames. It is also sourced when running local Spark applications or submission scripts.

Note that `conf/spark-env.sh` does not exist by default when Spark is installed. However, you can
copy `conf/spark-env.sh.template` to create it. Make sure you make the copy executable.

The following variables can be set in `spark-env.sh`:


<table class="table">
  <tr><th style="width:21%">Environment Variable</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>JAVA_HOME</code></td>
    <td>Location where Java is installed (if it's not on your default `PATH`).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code></td>
    <td>Python binary executable to use for PySpark.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_LOCAL_IP</code></td>
    <td>IP address of the machine to bind to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS</code></td>
    <td>Hostname your Spark program will advertise to other machines.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In addition to the above, there are also options for setting up the Spark
[standalone cluster scripts](spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts), such as number of cores
to use on each machine and maximum memory.

Since `spark-env.sh` is a shell script, some of these can be set programmatically -- for example, you might
compute `SPARK_LOCAL_IP` by looking up the IP of a specific network interface.

# Configuring Logging

Spark uses [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) for logging. You can configure it by adding a
`log4j.properties` file in the `conf` directory. One way to start is to copy the existing
`log4j.properties.template` located there.

# Overriding configuration directory

To specify a different configuration directory other than the default "SPARK_HOME/conf",
you can set SPARK_CONF_DIR. Spark will use the the configuration files (spark-defaults.conf, spark-env.sh, log4j.properties, etc)
from this directory.
