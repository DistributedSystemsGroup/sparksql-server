/**
 * :: Experimental ::
 *
 * Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic model designed for text documents.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *  - "word" = "term": an element of the vocabulary
 *  - "token": instance of a term appearing in a document
 *  - "topic": multinomial distribution over words representing some concept
 *
 * Currently, the underlying implementation uses Expectation-Maximization (EM), implemented
 * according to the Asuncion et al. (2009) paper referenced below.
 *
 * References:
 *  - Original LDA paper (journal version):
 *    Blei, Ng, and Jordan.  "Latent Dirichlet Allocation."  JMLR, 2003.
 *     - This class implements their "smoothed" LDA model.

    DEVELOPERS NOTE:

    This implementation uses GraphX, where the graph is bipartite with 2 types of vertices:
     - Document vertices
        - indexed with unique indices >= 0
        - Store vectors of length k (# topics).
     - Term vertices
        - indexed {-1, -2, ..., -vocabSize}
        - Store vectors of length k (# topics).
     - Edges correspond to terms appearing in documents.
        - Edges are directed Document -> Term.
        - Edges are partitioned by documents.

    Info on EM implementation.
     - We follow Section 2.2 from Asuncion et al., 2009.  We use some of their notation.
     - In this implementation, there is one edge for every unique term appearing in a document,
       i.e., for every unique (document, term) pair.
     - Notation:
        - N_{wkj} = count of tokens of term w currently assigned to topic k in document j
        - N_{*} where * is missing a subscript w/k/j is the count summed over missing subscript(s)
        - gamma_{wjk} = P(z_i = k | x_i = w, d_i = j),
          the probability of term x_i in document d_i having topic z_i.
     - Data graph
        - Document vertices store N_{kj}
        - Term vertices store N_{wk}
        - Edges store N_{wj}.
        - Global data N_k
     - Algorithm
        - Initial state:
           - Document and term vertices store random counts N_{wk}, N_{kj}.
        - E-step: For each (document,term) pair i, compute P(z_i | x_i, d_i).
           - Aggregate N_k from term vertices.
           - Compute gamma_{wjk} for each possible topic k, from each triplet.
             using inputs N_{wk}, N_{kj}, N_k.
        - M-step: Compute sufficient statistics for hidden parameters phi and theta
          (counts N_{wk}, N_{kj}, N_k).
           - Document update:
              - N_{kj} <- sum_w N_{wj} gamma_{wjk}
              - N_j <- sum_k N_{kj}  (only needed to output predictions)
           - Term update:
              - N_{wk} <- sum_j N_{wj} gamma_{wjk}
              - N_k <- sum_w N_{wk}
