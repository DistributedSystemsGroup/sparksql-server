 * This class manages write ahead log files.

 * Uses [[org.apache.spark.streaming.util.WriteAheadLogWriter]] to write

 *
 * @param logDirectory Directory when rotating log files will be created.
 * @param hadoopConf Hadoop configuration for reading/writing log files.
 * @param rollingIntervalSecs The interval in seconds with which logs will be rolled over.
 *                            Default is one minute.
 * @param maxFailures Max number of failures that is tolerated for every attempt to write to log.
 *                    Default is three.
 * @param callerName Optional name of the class who is using this manager.
 * @param clock Optional clock that is used to check for rotation interval.
